    This image guesses the maximum intensity of the 
    image by obtaining a smoothed version of the image

    Input

    d       Numpy array that contains the values of the pixels.

    #Â First, smooth the image with a median filter. For this, find 
    # the optimal window as the square-root of the geometric mean 
    # between the sizes of the array. This step is good to kill outliers:
    window = int(np.sqrt(np.sqrt(d.shape[0]*d.shape[1])))

    # been found, the outputs are numpy arrays and you want to extract the numbers 
    # and (2) in case there are several maximums (this has not happened so 
    # far but could in principle), pick the first of them:
    y0 = y0[0]
    x0 = x0[0]

    # Now estimate the width of the PSF by taking a "cross-plot" using the 
    # maximum values found:
